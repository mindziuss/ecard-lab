.NET Smart Card SDK Version 2.3.0.0 - January 13th, 2012


The .NET SDK version 2.3.0.0 differs from the earlier release 2.2.180.3490 in the following ways:

1.  Support for Visual Studio 2010 
2.  Improved install / uninstall
3.  Change Encryption Sink sample to remove usage of XML on card
4.  SDK now uses Microsoft .Net Framework v4 (Full) version.
5.  Removed support for Visual Studio .NET 2003

The details of these changes are listed below:

1. Support for Visual Studio 2010

  This release of .NET SDK has support for Visual Studio 2010 (also known as Visual Studio 10). 
  The support is provided both in the integration of Card Explorer in Visual Studio 2010 IDE, 
  and in the inclusion of samples code targeted for Visual Studio 2010.

  The Card Explorer is now integrated with the Visual Studio 2010 IDE.  After installing the SDK, 
  the Card Explorer tab is visible inside the Visual Studio 2010 IDE.

  The users of the .NET SDK do not have to do the manual conversion of the sample projects from 
  Visual Studio 2008 to Visual Studio 2010. The SDK includes separate copies of each sample 
  application for Visual Studio 2010. The Start menu shortcut has been updated to point to these 
  Visual Studio sample projects.

2. Improved install / uninstall 

  The installation now installs / uninstalls the samples and templates for just the versions of 
  Visual Studio that the user has on their machine.

3. Change Encryption Sink sample to remove usage of XML on card

  The latest smart card release no longer contains support for XML. The Encryption Sink sample 
  relied on the XML library to parse the configuration data. The Encryption Sink sample 
  has been modified to use an INI format for the configuration data. 

4. SDK now uses Microsoft .Net Framework v4 (Full) version.

  This release of .Net SDK had been converted to use Microsoft .Net Framework v4 full version.
  This framework must be installed prior to installation of this SDK. The installer can be downloaded from here:

5. Removeal of support for Visual Studio 2003 .Net

  This release of .NET SDK has removed support for Visual Studio .NET 2003 (also known as Visual Studio 7).
